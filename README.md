# Vulnerability Assessment Tool

## Overview
The **Vulnerability Assessment Tool** is a web application built using Streamlit that allows users to assess the security vulnerabilities of their Python projects. Users can upload `requirements.txt` files to check for known vulnerabilities in dependencies and `.py` files for static code analysis to identify security issues.

## Features
- **Dependency Scanning**: Upload a `requirements.txt` file to identify known vulnerabilities in Python package dependencies using the Safety tool.
- **Static Code Analysis**: Upload a `.py` file for static analysis with Bandit to detect potential security issues in the code.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive Streamlit interface for seamless file uploads and results display.
- **Real-time Feedback**: Get immediate results after file upload, with detailed vulnerability reports.

## Installation

Usage
Run the Streamlit application to start the tool:

streamlit run app.py
Uploading Files
requirements.txt: This file should contain your project's dependencies.
.py files: You can upload any Python script for static analysis.
